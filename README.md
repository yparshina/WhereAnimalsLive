ITP Thesis Project

Where Animals Live is portable exhibit that teaches kids ages 4 to 7 about 
geography and wildlife through a physical exploration of the world map.

The activity takes place on a 20′ x 15′ surface with the world map depicted on it. It can be set up on any wide, flat surface such as a park, a school yard or a gym. Young explorers receive an important mission of helping a group of lost animals find their home.

The animals are brightly colored, cute and easy to handle shapes (probably made of wood). With the help of visual clues and skills learned during a training session, kids set out to explore the map and place the creatures in their habitats. Successful placements are rewarded with immediate feedback (the animals could vibrate, make noises, light up, etc).
Additional incentives could include timed activities, group competitions, collectible badges, etc.

This repo documents the electronics that allow animals to treact to their placement on the map.
